They are strong, they are infested with insects, and they walk around all day spreading diseases and ticks. One of the strange side-effects of the rather recently created American suburbs (less than 100 years), is that deer populations have exploded due to an improved living and eating climate. Without consecutive extremely harsh winters (we can't control the weather yet) or an army of vigilante deer hunters (I would rather not), deer populations will continue to explode. Curtailing deer populations has a direct effect on curtailing deer-tick populations.\n"}]},testimonials:[{author:"Eric F.",quote:"I have a pet tick named Archibald.
